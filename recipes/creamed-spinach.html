    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This somewhat healthy creamed spinach recipe is lighter than traditional creamed spinach. It is a little easier, a little quicker, and a little more contemporary. Have all your ingredients ready to go ahead of time. It's a classic steak side dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) bags fresh spinach</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced shallot</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large soup pot over high heat; add spinach, cover, and cook for 1 minute. Uncover and gently stir until most of the leaves are bright green and wilted, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Quickly drain spinach in a strainer and transfer to a plate lined with 4 or 5 paper towels. Once cool enough to handle, squeeze as much liquid from the spinach as possible. Transfer spinach to a cutting board and coarsely chop.</li>
        <li>Mix cayenne pepper, nutmeg, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; stir in shallot and cook until just barely golden and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in seasoning mixture and pour in cream; increase heat to medium-high and simmer until the cream sauce reduces by about half, about 5 minutes. Stir in lemon zest.        </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and toss spinach with cream sauce in skillet. Cook and stir until spinach is heated through and coated, about 2 minutes. Stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
